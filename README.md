# Greenway  : this is insigt 2 session organised by Capgemini on 19 July 2023:

“My Team Story” – Group Activity

CANDIDATE INFORMATION

Overview of My Team Story 

“Welcome to My Team Story.  All the instructions you need are in front of you.  Let’s read the instructions together and then you can begin.” 

READ CANDIDATE INSTRUCTIONS

“This is a great chance to learn more about Capgemini’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CR&S) focus and how we support our clients to transform the way they operate. 

The reading material you each have in front of you provides information on Capgemini’s client ‘Greenway Consumables’. They have approached Capgemini to consult them on how they can get more of their employees engaged with CR&S activities via their existing internal App. They want to improve the design and content of the App and to make it accessible to external stakeholders.

Your challenge: 

After 5 minutes of individual preparation, you will come together as a group to discuss all the information you have been given and agree on the best idea for the content of the App and how it will look and feel. 

The assessor (identify which assessor) will assume the role of Sam Russell, the Capgemini Project Manager for this project and will give you updates as the task progresses. You can ask Sam any questions you may have throughout the exercise.

The objective of the group discussion is to work together using the information you have been given to share your thoughts on the best idea for this App and to complete the App template in the middle of the table. 

To be clear you have:
    • 5 minutes of reading time, on your own
    • 50 minutes of group discussion, detailed above”

Item 1: Email from your Project Manager 
(Email from Sam Russell, Project Manager at Capgemini)
Team,
I hope you are well?
As promised, please see below some comments the client made in today’s project meeting that they would like you to consider in the design of the App: 
    • Is the idea technically feasible?
    • The user experience is key – how easy is it to use?
    • Is the idea progressive, i.e. is there potential for future Apps to be developed?
    • Look and feel is crucial – it needs to feel like Greenway Consumables
The App needs to:
    • The App needs to explain to employees what they will get out of being involved in CR&S activities
    • Advertise the charitable opportunities employees can get involved with from a variety of different organisations (schools, charities) 
    • A news function so we can share all great things we are doing to support our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability agenda
    • Improve Greenway Consumables brand image in light of the recent bad press   
    • Achieve 75% adoption across the company

Look forward to hearing your ideas!

Many thanks,
Sam Russell

Item 2: Market Research 
(Focus groups conducted with the employee target audience within Greenway Consumables)
Key Comments from the focus groups:
“The App needs to let the user see upcoming charity events and book their place via the App rather than having to call the number listed.”
“The layout of the current App is confusing and as a result it took me a while to understand how to use it. This needs sorting out for the new App.”
“Provide users with a clear understanding of the opportunities on offer and their locations.”
“The content needs to resonate to this target audience.”
“The ability to connect and chat to existing employees who have completed certain charity assignments would be amazing and would encourage people to sign up.”
“I loved how simple the App was to use, you didn’t need any guidance at all on how to navigate the App.”
“The content of the current App is rarely updated, which is frustrating as I want to book another day with my charity that I know is coming up next month. I have had to go to them direct to arrange which makes the App a bit pointless to be honest.” 
“The content was always relevant and easy to understand.”


Item 3: Stakeholder Objectives for the App
(The key stakeholder objectives for the App that have been taken from the initial project brief )
Charities and Schools:
“The App needs to have the most up-to-date list of relevant opportunities we have available and we would like to resource at least 80% of the charitable opportunities we list on the App.”

Greenway Consumables Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Agenda Lead:
“Before we re-launch the App internally and release it publically, we need to ensure the App is fit for purpose and the content is fully delivered, even if this takes us longer.”

Greenway Consumables CEO:
“The App needs to be launched externally as soon as possible so we can begin to receive some good PR that will overshadow the environmental fines we received last month.”
